# Encrypting files with python
This is a challenge for the Global Hack Week: INIT 2023 Day 2 organized by Major League Hacking. It's a python program that encrypts files.

<sub>*This repository includes the files already created by the code for demonstration purposes, if you want to see everything from zero, delete the saved_key.key and the encryptedfile.txt files (you can also run the code how it is, it'll give you an error because the files already exists, but it'll work anyways overwriting the already created files)*</sub>
